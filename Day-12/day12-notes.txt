#### Day-12 Notes ####

1. Scopes: there are two types of scopes - global and local.
            Global Scope: it is accessible to everyone depending on where it has been defined
            Local Scope: it will be accessible inside the function

2. In python, there is no block scope, for example: if a variable is defined inside a if block it will still be consider as global variable

3. According to the best practice, we do not modify the Global scope variable. however, if needed can be updated using below syntax:
    enemies = 1
    def testing():
        global enemies # by using the global keyword we declared that the enemies is global and not local
        enemies += 1
