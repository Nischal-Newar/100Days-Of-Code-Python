#### Day-09 Notes ####

1. Dictionary: it is like JSON that stores the record in the format of key-value pair.
    -> for example: programming_dictionary = {
            "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected."
            "Loop": "the action of doing something over and over again"
        }
        here, programming_dictionary is a dictionary

    -> To retrieve the "Loop" value we use the syntax: programming_dictionary["Loop"]

    -> We can add records to dictionary by using the below syntax:
            programming_dictionary["Function"] = "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again." 
    
    -> We can overwrite the value for any key using hte below syntax:
            programming_dictionary["Bug"] = "A moth in your computer"
    
    -> Looping through the dictionary:
        for key in programming_dictionary:
            print(programming_dictionary[key])

2. Nesting dictionary in a dictionary:
    for example: travel_log = {
        "France": {
            "cities_visited": ["Paris", "Dijon"]
        }
    }

3. Nesting dictionary in  a list:
    for example: travel_log = [
        {
            "country": "France",
            "cities_visited": ["Paris", "Dijon"]
        }
    ]
