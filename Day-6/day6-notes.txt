#### Day-06 Notes ####

1. Functions: piece of code we can call anywhere to perform a specific task.
    declaration: def functionname():
                Do something inside.
    calling: functionname()

2. Indentation: indentation means the code which is inside a function. for example in the folder structure we see in windows or mac we see
                file is inside another folder. In python, indentation is important because we do not use '{}' to distinguish codes inside
                a function and outside a function.

3. Code Blocks

3. While Loop: It works in similar way to For loop. It will run a piece of code till the condition is True.
    declaration: while something_is_true:
                        #Do something
