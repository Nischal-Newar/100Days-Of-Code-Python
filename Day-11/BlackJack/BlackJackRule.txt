###### Black Jack Rule ########

## Your goal in blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21. 
## You’ll receive 2 cards at the beginning of each round, and you’ll add up the values of these cards. 
## Cards 2-10 have face value; King, Queen, Jack are worth 10; and Aces are either a 1 or an 11 — it’s up to you to decide.
## The dealer also draws two cards. The aim of the game is to beat his hand (have a higher hand) without going over 21.
## If you would like the dealer to deal you another card, you tell him “hit”
## If you do not want to be dealt another card, you “stand”
## “Busting” is when the sum of your hand is over 21. 
## The winner of the round is whoever has the highest hand without going bust.
