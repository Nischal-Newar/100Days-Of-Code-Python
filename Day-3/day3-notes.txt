#### Control FLow and Logical Operators ####

comparison operations
'>' -> greater than
'<' -> less than
'==' -> equal to
'>=' -> greater than equal to
'<=' -> less than equal to
'!=' -> not equal to

1. If Else condition -> we can use if else condition to change the flow of the code
    if height > 120:
    print('ride rollercoaster')
    else:
    print('Sorry, you have to be taller than 120 to ride the rollercoaster')

2. Nested If Else condition -> we can use nested if else and elif to check for further conditions
    if height > 120:
        if age >= 20:
            print('Pay $20')
        elif age < 13:
            print('Pay $15')
        else:
            print('Pay $18')
    else:
        print('You cannot rider the ')
