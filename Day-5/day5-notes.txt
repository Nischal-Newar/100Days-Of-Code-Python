#### Day-05 Notes ####

1. For loop: we can use For loop to loop through list and perform action as required.
    For example: list = ['hello', 'bye', 'see']
                 for x in list:
                    print(x)

                for x in range(0, 6) # this will loop from 0 to 6
                    print(i)
