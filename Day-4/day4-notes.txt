#### Day-04 Notes ####

1. Random numbers: random module can be used to generate random values
    There are multiple functions we can use from random module. For example - 
        -> random.randint(1, 10) : it will generate a random number between 1 and 10

2. Lists: we can store multiple values in a single variable using the list. This is part of the Data Structures.
    Format: fruits = ["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear"]
    if we go from left to right the index will be count as -> 0, 1, 2 and so on
    if we go from right to left the index will be count as -> -1, -2, -3 and so on

3. We can store lists inside list (Nested Lists).
    For example: value = [name, surname], name = ['XYZ', 'ABC'], surname = ['CDE', 'FGH']
    here value = [['XYZ', 'ABC'],['CDE', 'FGH']]
