#### Day-17 Notes ####

1. Create Custom Classes: we can create our own custom class using the keyword 'class'.
        Syntax: class className:
                    code...
2. We can use 'pass' keyword to bypass the function or class without defining anything inside it

3. We can use three different type of case for naming convention: PascalCase, camelCase and snake_case.
        In python, we usually use PascalCase for class name and snake_case for the rest. We rarely see camelCase for naming convention.

4. To declare the constructor inside the class, we use the function '__init__'.
    syntax:    def __init__(self, id, username):
                    self.id = id
                    self.username = username
    here, id and username are attributes

5. Everytime an object is created, the constructor (__init__) is called.
