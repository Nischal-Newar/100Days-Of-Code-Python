#### Day-10 Notes ####

1. Functions with output: we can use 'return' keyword to return a value from the function
    for example: def name(f_name, l_name):
                    formatted_name = f_name.titel() + ' ' + l_name.title()

2. Multiple return values: we can use multiple 'return' using If Else condition

3. Docstring: """ """, We can write multiple lines without any error. We use it to document our functions. We can use it as comment as well.
              However, it confuses many programmer as it can be used for storing long string values as well.
