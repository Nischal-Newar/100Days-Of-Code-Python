#### Day-19 Notes ####

1. Event Listeners: we can listen to events such as mouse click, keystroke to perform certain tasks.
2. Higher order function: A function is called Higher Order Function if it contains other functions
                          as a parameter or returns a function as an output.
3. Multiple objects: we can create multiple objects for a single class and can have different states.
                     for example, using turtle module, we create two different objects and assign different colors.
